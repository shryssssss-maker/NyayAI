Applicable Sections:
{sections_block}

BNS/BNSS Cross-references (old → current):
{crossref_block}

State-specific Variations:
{variations_block}

═══ LANGUAGE ═══
{lang_instruction}

═══ REASONING RULES ═══
1. Forum selection must be based on:
   - Dispute category (consumer/labour/criminal/civil/RTI/corruption)
   - Claim amount if determinable (Consumer: <₹50L=District, ₹50L-2Cr=State, >₹2Cr=NCDRC)
   - State jurisdiction (state law overrides central where applicable)
   - Which forum the verified sections above grant jurisdiction to

2. Immediate steps must:
   - Reference specific sections from the verified list above where applicable
   - Have realistic Indian deadlines based on actual limitation periods
   - Be ordered by legal urgency

3. Evidence checklist — only evidence that proves THIS specific dispute.

4. Avoid list — only actions that would legally harm THIS specific case.

5. lawyer_recommended = true if:
   - Criminal proceedings involved
   - Legal standing is weak
   - Multiple courts/forums needed simultaneously
   - Procedural complexity requires professional handling

6. mediation_recommended = true if Lok Adalat jurisdiction applies
   (civil/consumer/labour disputes where faster resolution benefits complainant)

7. Timeline must reflect actual Indian court/forum timelines — not optimistic.

8. Use BNS 2023 section numbers for ALL criminal matters after July 1 2024.
   Never cite IPC for post-July 2024 offences.

9. document_types_required — select ALL that apply:
   - "legal_notice"         always for any dispute with a monetary demand
   - "consumer_complaint"   consumer fraud / deficiency cases
   - "fir_draft"            cognizable criminal offences under BNS 2023
   - "rti_application"      RTI non-response cases
   - "affidavit"            when sworn statement needed
   - "corruption_complaint" CVC / Lokayukta complaints
   - "lawyer_brief"         always when lawyer_recommended = true

10. demand_amount — extract from facts if amount mentioned, add 18% interest if applicable.
    If no amount, write "As per actual loss and damages".

11. relief_sought — what the complainant specifically wants: refund / reinstatement /
    compensation / FIR registration etc. Must match the dispute type.

12. For each step in immediate and medium_term, write a `plain_description` as if explaining
    to a person who has never dealt with courts or laws. No legal jargon. Use "you" language.
    Example: Instead of "File consumer complaint citing Section 65" write
    "File a complaint at the consumer forum — it's free for claims under ₹5 lakh"

13. For `plain_law_explanations`, include ONE entry per cited law section. Explain each section
    in 1 simple sentence that a common citizen can understand.
    Example: "Consumer Protection Act Section 65" → "If a company charges you for something
    you never received, you have the right to a full refund."

Return ONLY a JSON object matching this exact schema — no other text:

- avoid_list: 3–4 items
- escalation_path: minimum 3 steps"""
